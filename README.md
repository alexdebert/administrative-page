### Quick start

#### 1. Run `npm install`

This will install all dependencies (listed in `package.json`) necessary to get you up and running.

#### 2. Run `npm start`

This will run two scripts concurrently:
1. `npm run api` will start [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to provide a stubbed out REST API through `localhost:9001`.
2. `npm run serve` will start [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) to serve up your application.  You should see your default browser open up a window pointing to `localhost:9000`.

#### 3. Navigate to `http://localhost:9000/`
